# Veo-licious Gems - Hackathon Submission One-Pager

**GDG Stanford Hackathon: Build with Google Gemini | November 15, 2024**

---

## 🚀 The Problem

33 million small businesses in the US struggle with social media marketing:
- **Agencies cost $2-5K/month** - unaffordable for most SMBs
- **DIY takes 5-10 hours/week** - time they don't have
- **Generic AI tools** produce obvious "AI slop" that doesn't match their brand

**Result:** Inconsistent posting, lost customers, and missed revenue opportunities.
