## Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to publish on all platforms?**
A: No. Minimum requirement is one blog post (Medium/Dev.to/Hashnode) and one X post with #CloudRunHackathon. LinkedIn is optional but recommended for additional reach.

**Q: Can I publish on multiple blog platforms?**
A: Yes! Publish on Dev.to first, then cross-post to Medium and Hashnode after 48 hours. Use canonical URLs to avoid SEO penalties.

**Q: How long should I wait between posts?**
A: Don't post everything at once. Spread over 3-5 days for maximum algorithmic reach. See PUBLISHING_GUIDE.md timeline.

A: See "Emergency Troubleshooting" section in PUBLISHING_GUIDE.md. Quick fixes: better posting time, add visuals, share to niche communities, ask friends to engage.

**Q: Do I need professional design skills?**
A: No. Use Canva templates (free) or just export the Mermaid diagrams as-is. Content quality matters more than design.

**Q: What's the minimum effort for 0.8 bonus points?**
